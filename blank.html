		<h3>Scatter Plot Analysis</h3>
		<p>
			On the form you track behavior ONLY WHEN IT OCCURS. On a good day, you mark nothing! 
			There is room for ABC Incident Analysis notes. The data may be entered into the computer for a 
			professional report, or paper forms may be stapled together to create  a self-graphing chart.

		<h3>End of the Day</h3>
			<p>
				The end of the day is a great time to review behavioral performance with a student. 
				It is a teaching moment...an opportunity. Successes can be rewarded, strategies can be taught 
				and reviewed. Students can learn to self evaluate. This program is so simple. And, if you 
				don’t want to enter data into the computer, the data collection form creates its own graph!!

		<h3>On Task Analysis</h3>
			<p>
				This is a half hour observation that gives you a very ‘visual’ report...lots of clear, easy to 
				understand graphs. When shown to parents, they clearly see how their child compares to average 
				peers. When shown to the family doctor, it provides good data to support concerns. (NOTE: This 
				observation is usually  done by a social worker, psychologist, teacher consultant, etc.)

		<h3>How Many Times</h3>
		<p>
			This is the simplest of all data collection. 
			Just move a penny from one pocket to another each time you see the target behavior. 
			At the end of the assessment period each day, simply count the pennies moved. 
			Record on a chart and/or enter into the computer. 
			Either way you get a very useful report! Check it out...

<h3>Education has evolved.</h3>
Decisions—both academic and behavioral—are data-driven. 
Classroom teachers are using data to develop Behavior Intervention Plans, 
to design interventions, and to Progress Monitor. In this site you will find TOOLS that 
simplify behavioral data collection, analysis, and reporting. 

Please stop by often as I will be updating content and modifying/adding programs &amp; forms.
Explore the site for the latest in News, Books, and
DATA COLLECTION FORMS &amp; TOOLS

for schools and for classrooms!

<h5>"This kid already takes up all my time! I don't have any more time to give!"</h5>
Think of how much time you would have if the behaviors disappeared! 
Spend a little time collecting data so you can apply interventions that pinpoint and specifically
target the causes of the behavior. Change things that WE can control and watch the behaviors fade away.
<p>Spend a little time on change - It's worth the investment!</p>
